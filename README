# aleph.experiments

Experimenting with various approaches with Aleph.

## Installation

Use lein to get all the dependencies. Then replace the official aleph and 
ring-core jars with jars created from my clones of those repos:

	git://github.com/rosado/aleph.git
	git://github.com/rosado/ring.git  (aleph-compatible branch)
